Zyxel NAS326 seems to have some annoying bug I couldn't get rid of: When you delete a directory from Windows Explorer via SMB, it deletes the contents, but the directory stays there.

Therefore I decided to see if I can make a python script to clean up the folders afterwards.

Ultimately this is a learning project for me - I love Python and what better way to learn it than by using it to do something :)
